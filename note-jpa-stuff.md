### Random stuff
- Use `@Repository` to enable exception translation from JPA exceptions to Springâ€™s `DataAccessException` hierarchy

### The `equals/hashCode` conundrum
- application `uuid id` generation (instead of letting hibernate/database generate it)
- go with `Object` implementations
- do a per class implementation based on `instanceof` and the `id` field, and just don't put non-persisted entities in collections
- as above, but create a `@MappedSuperclass` for single implementation and use a single sequence for all tables, [mind the disadvantages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1536479/asking-for-opinions-one-sequence-for-all-tables)
